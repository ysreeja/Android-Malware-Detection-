# Android-Malware-Detection- DIGI GUARDIAN: MALWARE DETECTION

Mobile devices have become vital to everyone’s lifestyle. It is hard to imagine one’s day without them.
However, because we rely on mobile phones so heavily, certain malware attacks have been rapidly
growing. A user tends to download an application from the app store for various reasons. Most of the
time we neglect to check the permission settings that are granted for an application in default and
proceed ahead without thinking twice. Certain default permissions turn into a path that leads to malware
attacks on our devices. Malicious software gets downloaded and thereby causes significant risks. This
malware, once present, poses significant threats to personal data and security. As hackers continue to
exploit various vulnerabilities in IoT systems, the seamless integration of IoT technology into our lives
is at risk.

To tackle these increasingly complex challenges, there is a pressing demand for the development of a
resilient system designed to proficiently detect and classify malware across a spectrum of devices,
encompassing both mobile and IoT systems. To address these converging challenges, the need arises
for a robust system capable of detecting malware on mobile devices, ensuring a secure digital
environment for all. The model being developed must be able to classify whether the data is Malware
i.e., our class of interest, or safe i.e., Benign based on the permissions as requested.

We have chosen our dataset from the UCI repository as follows:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/722/naticusdroid+android+permissions+dataset

DATASET DESCRIPTION:
Here we are considering a dataset that includes features that help classify whether the application is
Benign or Malignant.
The chosen dataset has 86 distinct features and 29333 instances, which can be used to train and test
our model. Each column represents a specific permission granted to that application.
The features include the following:
• Read Access: Access to read the data present
• Write Access: Access to edit the data such as user preferences
• Location Access: Whether the location of the user must be available to the application
• External Storage Access: Access to External Storage
• Cache Memory Access: Access to cache memory
• Receive SMS: Access to message alerts
• Manage Accounts: Whether multiple accounts data needs to be saved
• Install Shortcuts: Access to create shortcuts on the homepage of the device
• Bluetooth Access: Whether Bluetooth needs to be enabled always or not
• Camera Access: Whether camera access must be provided to that application
• Billing Access: Whether credit card or debit card details need to be saved
• Authentication Access: Access to verify the user’s identity
The dataset is comprised of binary values either 0 or 1. A binary value 0 indicates that permission has
not been requested while value 1 indicates that permission is required for that application.
The Result column denotes the presence or absence of malware. In the future, we can anticipate whether
the application is malicious or not based on the permissions requested.
PLAN:
1. Data Pre-Processing:
a. We clean our data by handling missing values appropriately.
b. Encode categorical variables, if any, using one hot encoding.
c. Standardize numerical variables if any, using normalization.
2. Data Visualization: Exploring the data and displaying it in a visual form is an important step
to help us understand anomalies like outliers and analyze the trends.
3. Feature Selection:
a. We perform feature selection to extract the most relevant features.
b. Categorize them accordingly to select the important features.
4. Model Training:
a. Split the data into training data and test data.
b. The model is trained and tested using certain algorithms like Decision trees, Knearest
neighbours, and Logistic Regression.
5. Model Evaluation:
a. The performance of the model is evaluated against various performance factors like
Precision, Sensitivity, Accuracy, Specificity, and F1-Score. This evaluation phase
helps us in selecting the most reliable model.
b. Using the Confusion matrix, and ROC curve, we try to analyze the models’
predictions.
c. We will use this model on new data to evaluate its performance
